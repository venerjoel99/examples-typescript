This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Install Restack Web UI 

To install the Restack Web UI, you can use Docker.
```
docker run -d --pull always --name studio -p 5233:5233 -p 6233:6233 -p 7233:7233 ghcr.io/restackio/restack:main
```
# Schedule Restack workflow from NextJS frontend

The example is a NextJS application with front and backend. You can schedule the workflow example from the user interface. 

![Example UI](./restack-examples-ts-nextjs.png)

When the client successfully schedules the workflow, you can see the started workflow in the Restack Web UI. You should see the following screen:

![Success Web UI](./restack-examples-ts-nextjs-web-ui.png)

Now you can add a backend to the example. In other examples, you can see how to ideally structure the backend app with workflows, functions and services.

## Deploy on Restack

To deploy this Next.js application on Restack, you can use the provided `restack_up.mjs` script. This script utilizes the Restack Cloud SDK to define and deploy your application stack. It sets up the necessary environment variables and configures the Next.js application for deployment. 

To get started, ensure you have the required Restack Cloud credentials and environment variables set up. Then, run the script to initiate the deployment process. 

For more detailed information on deploying your repository to Restack, refer to the [Restack Cloud deployment documentation](https://docs.restack.io/restack-cloud/deployrepo).
