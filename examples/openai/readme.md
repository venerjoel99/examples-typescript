## Deploy on Restack

pnpm restack-up

To deploy the application on Restack, you can use the provided `restack_up.mjs` script. This script utilizes the Restack Cloud SDK to define and deploy your application stack. It sets up the necessary environment variables and configures the application for deployment. 

To get started, ensure you have the required Restack Cloud credentials and environment variables set up. Then, run the script to initiate the deployment process. 

For more detailed information on deploying your repository to Restack, refer to the [Restack Cloud deployment documentation](https://docs.restack.io/restack-cloud/deployrepo).
