# Restack AI - Discord Human in the loop example

This example will illustrate how you can utilize the Discord API and the Discord bot to get new messages from a channel and reply accordingly

The idea is the loop workflow will do the following:

1. Read new messages with the bot tagged after the last messages the bot sent.
2. Reverse a message and reply with the backwards message on the channel.
3. If a 'STOP' message is detected with the bot tagged, the loop will end.

# Requirements

- Node 20 or higher

```

# Start services

Go to this directory and run

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token> npm run service
```

Your code will be running and syncing with Restack engine to execute workflows or functions.
